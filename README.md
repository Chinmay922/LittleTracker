An application to monitor productivity.
Self analysis in one of the best ways to measure productivity on a day-to-day or weekly basis. This can be done on personal as well as professional levels but there is there is no proper metric to measure the productivity of an individual. Due to which they should be provided with self monitoring applications in their workplace. Software developers spend most of their day using computer either for work, leisure, or other activities. So, analyzing the activities performed in most of their day will provide a better idea on how to work on increasing productivity. If provided with resources to monitor day to day productivity for engineers/developers with productivity monitoring/tracking applications and interactive results daily a better understanding of putting more efforts to manage time can be worked out. A lot of research has been happening on how self-analyzing can be performed and what an individual expects from such applications. It is not sufficient to consider only the amount of code written by developers or time spent on specific software but also how they manage to communicate with teammates, learn skills for various other resources or other ways to contribute to the work. On an everyday basis software developers not only writes code but also contribute to projects, communicate with people, search for other research happening around the world to get a better understanding of interpersonal improvement, and reading artifacts.
